# Project List:

## Digit Recognition System using AI

 The object of this project is to generate a ML model from a kaggle datasheet of handwritten digits. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on the raspberry pi. Then implement the model in a digit recognition system involving a raspberry pi, pi camera, and sensehat. Then an user could write a number on a dry erase board or piece of paper, and the raspberry pi will determine what number is shown regardless of the handwriting issues. The number is then displayed on the sensehat.

## Cats & Dog Classification

This code involves using Juypter Notebook and python packages to come up with a CNN model that will classify between a dog and cat. The user will upload an image and run the code, and the model will determine if the picture is a dog or cat.

## MightyMover

This is my senior design project for my last year of being an undergraduate. The project is worked on with a team of 4 with no outside help. We did all the research and came up with this idea. The MightyMover is a rc car that follows the user's bluetooth device. The rc car will later be built up to a wagon to help the physically disable carry things or help user's in their gardens. 

## Squid Games

This is a complicated arduino project simulating the popular tv show *Squid Games*. The project includes a MEGA 2560, servo motors, leds, ultrasonic sensor, and more. If you're looking for a fun project, this may be something that you need to try on your own.

## Rover Controls with FPGA

This project includes designing (schematics), VHDL design files, VHDL test bench files, and Vivado simulation of controlling a rover's motors.

## Traffic Light Intersection with CPLD

This project includes designing (schematics), VHDL design files, encoding a CPLD, and implementation of a complicated 4 way traffic stop.
